# House of X/Powers of X (Marvel)

Screw recency bias. Jonathan Hickman's return to superhero comics with these parallel X-Men books took the industry by storm. It's hard to remember the last time it felt like everyone on social media was feverishly reading the same comic every Wednesday and on pins and needles waiting for the next issue. Beyond their zeitgeist-seizing power, these two books—which chronicled mutantkind's proactive attempts to ensure their survival in a world that was literally trying to extinguish them—also revitalized Marvel's X-Men line, infusing it with thrilling and powerful ideas (those data pages!) that will surely (or hopefully) generate fantastic stories for years to come. —C.A.
