# My Favorite Thing Is Monsters (Fantagraphics)

A masterpiece, an instant classic. What else is there to say? Well, it is worth noting how close we came to never reading this book at all. Emil Ferris only started working on her first graphic novel after a mosquito bite gave her West Nile virus and struck her with paralysis at age 40. Then, after she worked on it for 15 years as a way of recovering from her paralysis, all copies of My Favorite Thing Is Monsters were seized by the Panama government after the sudden bankruptcy of shipping giant Hanjin. It's a miracle that we can read the story of Karen Reyes, the 10-year-old girl living in 1968 Chicago who imagines herself as a wolf girl and loses herself in horror movies as a way of dealing with her mom's sickness, her brother's impending Vietnam draft, the mysterious murder of her Holocaust-survivor neighbor, and her own incipient sexuality. My Favorite Thing Is Monsters is drawn as if it's Karen's notebook, the lined pages of which are filled with the colorful, monstrous doodles of her feverish imagination. It's a feast for the eye and soul, and there's still a whole other volume to go. â€”C.H.
