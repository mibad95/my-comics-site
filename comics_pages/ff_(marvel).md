# FF (Marvel)

The biggest movies of the 2010s looked like the comic books of 30 years ago, clashing infinite crossovers into the darkest of nights. Which, if I'm doing the math correctly, means the mainstream pop culture of 2040s will resemble the comic books of right now. And something about this short-lived Fantastic Four spin-off, relaunched for a 16-issue run amid the Marvel Now! initiative, still feels like the future. This is the spinniest of spin-offs, colliding multiple strands of Four lore into a tie-in team featuring familiar icons (She-Hulk! Ant-Man!) and minor characters renewed with personality to spare (Artie, Leech, and the Moloids!). Matt Fraction's cosmic farce blends self-aware cleverness with goofy-sweet humanity, and Michael Allred's trademark art-pop illustrations set the stage for his spaced-out work on the acclaimed Silver Surfer. â€”Darren Franich
