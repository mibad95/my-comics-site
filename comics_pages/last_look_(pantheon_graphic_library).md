# Last Look (Pantheon Graphic Library)

A fearfully strange epic of the mind from comics legend Charles Burns. X'ed Out, The Hive, and Sugar Skull appeared in two-year intervals like postcards from the deepest underground, revealing a story of lost romance trapped between bad memories, cartoon nightmares, and an all-encompassing mood of nefarious guilt. The result is a sharp yet elusive portrait of a man who's somehow running away from himself even as he eats his own tail. â€”D.F.
