# Lumberjanes (Boom! Box)

Friendship to the max! As good as it is to have art that looks unflinchingly at the dark sides of human existence, it's also important to enjoy warm, fuzzy stories that show you things you never even knew you needed. Lumberjanes was originally only supposed to be a four-issue series from writers Grace Ellis, Noelle Stevenson, and Shannon Watters and artist Brooklyn Allen. But the adventures of Jo, April, Mal, Molly, and Ripley (the titular Lumberjanes, a.k.a Girl Scouts who punch monsters and solve ancient mysteries) proved so addictive that the comic has now published more than 60 issues. Here, feminist icons were name-dropped like legendary heroes ("Holy Mae Jemison!") and same-sex love was portrayed with an easy warmth that would carry over into both Ellis' subsequent comic Moonstruck and Stevenson's She-Ra and the Princesses of Power reboot. There were mysteries to solve (why are there so many monsters around this summer camp, anyway?), but at the end of the day nothing was more important than reveling in the beautiful friendship of these bright young characters. â€”C.H.
