# Batman (DC)

In this decade, DC gave us two contrasting yet very personal takes on the Dark Knight. During the disappointing New 52 experiment, Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo harvested their fears about life's dangers and parenthood to deliver a story that focused on Batman's place in Gotham City. Yes, it's easy to make fun of how often the series asked, "What is Gotham?" but that question fueled the entire run and introduced new and daring concepts to Batman's mythos. On the flip side, certified wife guy Tom King, working with a killer roster of artists (including Mikel Janin, Joëlle Jones, Clay Mann, and more), used his marriage as inspiration for a poignant tale that looked inward at Bruce and explored how the mere idea of happiness could challenge him. There were some rough patches in the run to be sure, but the highs ("Rooftops," "War of Jokes and Riddles," "Double Date," Batman Annual #2) are so heartbreakingly beautiful that they make it easy to ignore the lows. Batman is an 80-year-old character, and yet both teams managed to make him their own. In conclusion: Kite Man, hell yeah! —Chancellor Agard
